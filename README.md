# remote-streamerbot-chat

A lightweight live chat overlay that connects to a remote [Streamer.bot](https://streamer.bot/) instance over WebSocket and displays Twitch/YouTube chat messages in a clean dark-themed browser window.

---

## How It Works

```
Streamer.bot (Windows PC at 10.0.0.195)
        │
        │  WebSocket  ws://10.0.0.195:8080
        │
Linux machine
  └── ./chat  (bash script)
        └── helium-browser  (Chromium-based)
              └── chat.html  (UI + streamerbot-client.js)
```

1. The `chat` script launches an isolated Helium browser window pointed at `chat.html` via a `file://` URL.
2. `chat.html` loads the bundled `streamerbot-client.js` library and opens a WebSocket connection to Streamer.bot.
3. Incoming `Twitch.ChatMessage` and `YouTube.ChatMessage` events are parsed and rendered in real time.

No HTTP server is involved — the page loads directly from disk.

## Requirements

| Dependency | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `helium-browser` | Chromium-based browser used to display the overlay |
| `bash` | Runs the launcher script |

Python, curl, and a web server are **not** required.

## Setup

### 1. Streamer.bot (Windows machine)

1. Open Streamer.bot.
2. Go to **Servers/Clients → WebSocket Server**.
3. Enable the WebSocket server.
4. Set the **bind address** to your LAN IP (e.g. `10.0.0.195`) — **not** `127.0.0.1`, otherwise remote connections will be refused.
5. Set the port to `8080` (or update `chat.html` to match your chosen port).
6. Make sure your Windows firewall allows inbound connections on that port.

### 2. Linux machine

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/remote-streamerbot-chat.git
cd remote-streamerbot-chat
```

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x chat
```

Edit `chat.html` and update the host/port to match your Streamer.bot machine:

```js
const client = new StreamerbotClient({
    host: "10.0.0.195",  // ← your Streamer.bot machine's LAN IP
    port: 8080,
    password: "",         // ← fill in if you set a password in Streamer.bot
    autoReconnect: true,
    ...
});
```

## Usage

```bash
./chat
```

Or from anywhere:

```bash
~/github/remote-streamerbot-chat/chat
```

The overlay opens as a standalone app window (no browser chrome/address bar) with:

- A **dark header** showing "Live Chat" and a connection status badge
  - 🟠 Orange = Connecting…
  - 🟢 Green = Connected
  - 🔴 Red = Disconnected
- Each chat message shows:
  - 🟣 Twitch or 🔴 YouTube platform icon
  - User badges (broadcaster, subscriber, etc.)
  - Username in the user's chat colour
  - Message text
  - Timestamp

The window blocks the terminal until it is closed, then exits cleanly.

## How the Script Works

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

CHAT_FILE="$HOME/github/remote-streamerbot-chat/chat.html"
PROFILE_DIR="$HOME/.config/streamerbot-chat-profile"
```

- **`CHAT_FILE`** — absolute path to the HTML file, hardcoded to `$HOME`.
- **`PROFILE_DIR`** — a persistent isolated Chromium profile stored in `~/.config`. Keeping it persistent avoids a slow first-run initialisation on every launch.

```bash
rm -f "$PROFILE_DIR/SingletonLock" "$PROFILE_DIR/SingletonCookie" "$PROFILE_DIR/SingletonSocket"
```

Chromium writes a `SingletonLock` file to prevent two instances sharing a profile. If the browser crashes or is killed, the lock is never cleaned up, causing subsequent launches to hand the URL off to a non-existent process (resulting in a grey window). Only the lock files are removed — the rest of the profile is preserved.

```bash
helium-browser \
  --user-data-dir="$PROFILE_DIR" \
  --disable-gpu \
  --ozone-platform=x11 \
  --no-first-run \
  --no-default-browser-check \
  --disable-extensions \
  --allow-file-access-from-files \
  --disable-web-security \
  --class="StreamerBotChat" \
  "file://${CHAT_FILE}"
```

| Flag | Reason |
|---|---|
| `--user-data-dir` | Forces a new isolated browser process; prevents URL handoff to an existing Helium session |
| `--disable-gpu` | Works around a `vaInitialize failed` GPU error that causes grey windows on some systems |
| `--ozone-platform=x11` | Explicitly selects X11 rendering on X11 sessions |
| `--no-first-run` | Skips the new-profile welcome screen |
| `--no-default-browser-check` | Suppresses the "make Helium your default browser" prompt |
| `--disable-extensions` | Prevents extensions (e.g. uBlock) from initialising, speeding up startup |
| `--allow-file-access-from-files` | Allows `file://` pages to load local scripts (e.g. `streamerbot-client.js`) |
| `--disable-web-security` | Allows `file://` pages to open WebSocket connections to remote hosts |
| `--class=StreamerBotChat` | Sets the X11 window class, useful for window manager rules |

The script runs Helium in the **foreground** (no `&`), so it naturally blocks until the window is closed — no need to track PIDs.

## Updating the Streamer.bot Client Library

`streamerbot-client.js` is a local copy of the
[`@streamerbot/client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@streamerbot/client) npm package.
It is bundled locally so the overlay works without internet access.

To update it to the latest version:

```bash
curl -sL "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@streamerbot/client/dist/streamerbot-client.js" \
  -o ~/github/remote-streamerbot-chat/streamerbot-client.js
```

---

## Changing the Streamer.bot Host or Port

Edit `chat.html` and update the `StreamerbotClient` constructor:

```js
const client = new StreamerbotClient({
    host: "10.0.0.195",  // LAN IP of the machine running Streamer.bot
    port: 8080,          // WebSocket server port set in Streamer.bot
    password: "",        // Leave empty if no password is set
    autoReconnect: true,
    ...
});
```

---

## Installing as a Desktop Application

Run the included install script to register the overlay as an application in your launcher (rofi, dmenu, GNOME, KDE, etc.):

```bash
./install.sh
```

This will:
- Make the `chat` script executable
- Write a `.desktop` entry to `~/.local/share/applications/streamerbot-chat.desktop` using the correct absolute path automatically
- Refresh the desktop database so the entry appears in your launcher immediately

You can then launch **StreamerBot Chat** from your application launcher like any other app, no terminal needed.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Grey/blank window on launch**
The `SingletonLock` cleanup in the script handles this automatically. If it still happens, delete the entire profile and let it rebuild:
```bash
rm -rf ~/.config/streamerbot-chat-profile
```

**Status stays "Connecting…" forever**
- Confirm Streamer.bot is running on the Windows machine.
- Confirm the WebSocket server in Streamer.bot is enabled and bound to the LAN IP (not `127.0.0.1`).
- Test connectivity from the Linux machine:
  ```bash
  nc -zv 10.0.0.195 8080
  ```
- Check that the Windows firewall allows inbound TCP on port 8080.

**Messages appear but are blank**
The payload structure from Streamer.bot changed. Open `chat.html`, add `onData: (raw) => console.log(raw)` to the `StreamerbotClient` constructor, relaunch, and inspect the browser console (right-click → Inspect) to see the raw payload shape. Then update `handleChatMessage` accordingly.

**"Opening in existing browser session" and nothing loads**
An existing Helium window is running without `--user-data-dir`. The `SingletonLock` cleanup and `--user-data-dir` flag together prevent this. If it recurs, kill all Helium processes:
```bash
pkill helium
```
Then relaunch with `./chat`.
